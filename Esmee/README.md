## Color Picker Concept 

#####Remove Shadow

You're thinking about to paint a wall in your house, but a part of the wall is predominates of shadows. 
Now you have choosen a color but a part of the wall is darker because of the shadow then the color that you wanted. This color picker makes your wall balanced in one color. 

This color picker translates different color gradient on the picture of the wall in one equal colors.  With this you're wall has one color. The sun with it's shadows plays no role anymore. 

The Color picker is inspired by the Mitre 10 Virtual Wall Painter.

## Your Own Tool

### Ruler Tool Concept
In Indesign, Photoshop and Illustrator are the pageviews different by every percent. When you want 100% pageview it's in indesign smaller then in photoshop. The problem is you whant to see an A4 page but when you take it om you screen it's bigger or smaller. How do you know if the image and text are too big or too small?

The Ruler Tool gives you full size images where you can compare now if you image is bigger then you own pen. It makes it easyer to reference your design to objects that you carry.

The Color picker is inspired by http://morris-photographics.com/photoshop/shortcuts/index.html
