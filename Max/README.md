Color Printer App

With this color picker tool, you’ll never have to worry about having the wrong colors again. 

It works as follows:
So you’re working in photoshop… indesign.. illustrator or another adobe program. 
You are adding a swatch to your swatch panel because it looks great in the design you are currently working on, and you want to save it for later… 

But.. most of the time, your design will surpass your screen and be printed on paper. Will your beloved colors hold the same charisma as they had digitally? With this color picker you don’t have to second guess yourself, you add the swatch to your swatch panel, and it will automatically send a document to your default printer, and with the practical design, you can also add it to your own color steel card.
