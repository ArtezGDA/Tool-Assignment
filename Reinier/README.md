## Color Picker
When you’re getting too comfortable using the same colours over and over again. You could choose to import this adobe add-on. This addon will use all the colors in your library. When you keep using the same colours everytime you are using any Adobe software this addon will block that colour. You can’t use that specific colour anymore. Why not? Because you are not using any other colours in your library. So this Adobe Add-on wil give you the oppurtunity to use all the colours in your Adobe colour library.
