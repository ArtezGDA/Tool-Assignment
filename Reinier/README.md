# Reinier's Tools

## Color Blocker
When you’re getting too comfortable using the same colours over and over again. You could choose to import this adobe add-on. This addon will use all the colors in your library. When you keep using the same colours everytime you are using any Adobe software this addon will block that colour. You can’t use that specific colour anymore. Why not? Because you are not using any other colours in your library. So this Adobe Add-on wil give you the oppurtunity to use all the colours in your Adobe colour library.

## Your Own Tool
This tool is completely based on my personal brain. How does it work when I am in a situation with a negative vibe or how will react in a positive enviroment. With this tool you will learn what my perpective could be about these situations. For example someone comes up to you and says that he didnt really like your work for a class. How will I react or how do I think I have to react. You will find out right here.
### Concept
This is an applescript that is being used as some sort of application or program to visualize the idea. You will get pop-up questions about some situations where a specific reaction is needed. You could stay positive and pretend you really dont care about anything. Or you could be someone that sees everything negatively. What you have to find out is how you will get out of the loop. Is it possible to stay positive or is it really neccesary to be negative all the time. 
### Sketch
Here a small visualization of the tool how it should work.

<br>
The problem was that i couldn't find our how i could link buttons to each other. This made it more difficult to create the loop.

When i found out how to link all the buttons with a [flowchart](2_flowchart.png) and for example "on my_negeer" i could connect the dots.

When I talked about this piece of code with our Timebased Media teacher Donna Verheijden. She thought it would be good to make more use of applescript and try to look in the possibilities. With these pop-up messages you could also make some video's pop-up. Video's that are relevant to the topic. To make the visualization more living.

### How to install and use
For this tool you will need AppleScript Editor, this is pre-installed on every Mac/Macbook. Just in case, the tool is created on MacOS X El Capitan Version 10.11.3. When you encounter some failures in applescript you could try to solve this with making your Mac up to date to the same version.

Are you a windows-user And still want to see what is happening in this script? I recommend you use A Virtual Machine or a second OS on your laptop. With a virtual machine you can virtually run a Mac OS X without even installing it. A example for a virtual machine can you find [here](http://www.vmware.com).
