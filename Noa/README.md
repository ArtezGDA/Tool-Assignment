## Color Picker

### Concept & Sketch

My concept for the color picker was being able to save a color from a webpage. This trough using a google chrome extension. Which ables you to click on the color picker tool, then click on the color in the webpage that you would like to add to you color database, and save it for later.

## Your Own Tool

### Concept

This tool is for being able to have a preview in your finder of indesign files. Normally you have to open your indesign to see the content of an .indd file. With this tool all the .indd files in your finder will automaticly have a .pdf file with the first page of your .indd file. So you can use that to see which file you need.
