### Concept & Sketch

BIN MIXER

With placing files to your computer's trash bin, you are changing the color of your desktop image. The script registers the files that are placed in the bin location en adjusts the RGB-composition. Formats are divided into 3 kinds: images (jpeg, png, bmp, gif), multimedia (mp3, mp4, mov, wov) and other (folder, zip, disk, txt, rtf).

IF you empty the trash bin, the parameters are set to 0. So the color will be black again, ready to get lighter and more saturated.

## Your Own Tool

### Concept

TRAVEL TEXT TOOL

A tool that transforms webpages into a readable, easy to handle PDF-file, that only has to be fold and stapled. The script scrapes the text from the webpage with beautifulsoup and pastes it in a PlotDevice-code that designs the page. It prints the text in a 2 column a5 format to a PDF file, that only has to be re-ordered to be finished as a booklet ready to print.

The reason why this would be helpful, is because I often stumble upon interesting webpages or articles that I really want to read but keeps me from my tasks. Everyday I travel by train in a total of 40 minutes and would like to read the texts while I sit in the train. I don't like reading from a screen so a ready-to-go code to transform these texts would be very helpful.

### Sketch

To show how many paper it will save to print in this format instead of the default 'print this page' function.
