## Color Picker

### Concept & Sketch
I made a reversed colourpicker. In Photoshop, Illustrator or another program you can pick a colour of the image and you can use that colour. But you can't pick a colour and let Photoshop search for that colour. This tool tackles that problem and search for the colour in an imago or video you've picked.
