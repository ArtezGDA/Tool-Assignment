## Color Picker

### Concept & Sketch

Colors come to life in 3D. In one of the classes we were shown a 3d pyramid shape were colors could be in detected. I thought this was a fascinating thing so I based my color picker on this concept. Because we can all see color, but what kind of shape is connected with that color? So I want to connect a range of shapes to the RGB colors. If you start with blue the shape will be a square. But if you add a little red, the shape will change. You'll have these sliders next to your shape to play with.
