### Concept & Sketch


“My favourite photo”

This colour picker tool is meant for your favourite photo. 
We all have this one photo that we love.
With this tool this one photo becomes more than just a photo, I want that the tool creates a few points in the picture en takes a colour from that, for example 9 different points, so 9 different colours. When you load an image that excises just out of one colour (the 9 different colour points from the photo) and google image search gives it a name. I want that this automatically happens with all the 9 points.
After this step we are left with 9 different names.
I want that these 9 names are being put into Pinterest one by one. When Pinterest loads you see only one colour from the pictures it gives. I want that saves these colours from the first 4 photos. When the images are fully loaded i want that also the first 4 photos are being saved.

When this happens with all the 9 different its creates 36 new colours en 36 new images, all been derived from your one favourite photo.
