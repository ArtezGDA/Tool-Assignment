### Concept & Sketch

Colour Arrangement

## Color Picker
This colourpicker is meant for people who have some colour arranging to do. Sometimes a bookshelf looks disheveled and the way to make it look more tidy is to arrange them by colour! An overfull bookcase is much easier on the eye when books with the same cover colours are next to eachother. But how to arrange those books, there are so many options! With this tool you can see what an arrangment will look like without even touching your books.
